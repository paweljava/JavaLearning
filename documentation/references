Tasks:
1. Data structures - Create datastructures package and create class per exercise. Implement the needed logic in main() method.
Use integers(Integer) as data structure data, if there is a need for 2 lists with various elements, create them.
In case of map use Map<Integer, String> data type.
a) Write a Java program to replace the second element of a ArrayList with the specified element.
b) Write a Java program to print all the elements of a ArrayList using the position of the elements.
c) Write a Java program to check if a particular element exists in a linked list.
d) Write a Java program to convert a linked list to array list.
e) Write a Java program to compare two sets and retain elements which are same on both sets.
f) Write a Java program to remove all of the elements from a hash set.
g) Write a Java program to get the value of a specified key in a map
h) Write a Java program to get a set view of the keys contained in this map


i)* Write your own LinkedList implementation(you can try to google this problem, example https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-a-linked-list-in-java-using-class/)
j)* Prepare answers for questions:
What data structure is best for keeping unique elements and why?
What data structure is best for fast reads and why?
What data structure is best for fast writes and why?

2. Finish console app
